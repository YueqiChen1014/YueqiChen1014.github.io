- company: Improved bounds and the construction of optimal (r,&#948)-locally repairable codes
  position: Improved bounds of optimal (r,&#948)-locally repairable codes 
  duration: Jun, 2021 &mdash; Jul, 2023
  summary: 123 <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Locally repairable codes (LRCs) are a class of codes widely used in distributed storage systems that optimize repair locality. Traditional r-LRCs could only recover a single erased symbol of codeword by assessing at most r other symbols in each local repair block; we 
analyzed the generalized LRCs of (r,&#948)-locality with optimal minimum Hamming distance to tolerate multiple node failures.</li><li>Significantly improved the upper bound with weaker assumptions on the code length n of linear LRCs that is tight in at least three 
special cases, including d = 2&#948+2 and d = 2&#948+1 where d denotes the minimum distance; this bound can be exactly achieved in the above cases by existing constructions.</li><li>Provided an equivalent existence condition for the optimal (r=2, &#948)-LRCs with disjoint local subcodes using the parity-check matrix 
approach and restated the existence condition via finite projective planes using the sunflower construction technique from Galois geometry.</li></ul>
