    - project: Improved bounds of optimal (r,&#948)-locally repairable codes
      duration: Jun, 2021 &mdash; Jul, 2023
      summary: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Locally repairable codes (LRCs) are a class of codes widely used in distributed storage systems that optimize repair locality. Traditional r-LRCs could only recover a single erased symbol of codeword by assessing at most r other symbols in each local repair block; we analyzed the generalized LRCs of (r,&#948)-locality with optimal minimum Hamming distance to tolerate multiple node failures.</li><li>Significantly improved the upper bound with weaker assumptions on the code length n of linear LRCs that is tight in at least three special cases, including d = 2&#948+2 and d = 2&#948+1 where d denotes the minimum distance; this bound can be exactly achieved in the above cases by existing constructions.</li><li>Provided an equivalent existence condition for the optimal (r=2,&#948)-LRCs with disjoint local subcodes using the parity-check matrix approach and restated the existence condition via finite projective planes using the sunflower construction technique from Galois geometry.</li><li>Introduced a framework for future research on the maximum code length and constructions of optimal (r,&#948)-LRCs with small localities in which fewer symbols are required for recovery of the failure nodes.</li><li>Contributed as third-author to the paper, “Some Results on the Improved Bound and Construction of Optimal (r,&#948)-locally repairable codes”, published at the IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications, 2022.</li></ul>
